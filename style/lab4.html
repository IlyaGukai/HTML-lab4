While I’m studying and living with my family, I have not serious problems. I try to do all my homework and tasks on deadlines. And I often get high marks. But nowadays I have really difficult challenge. I’m going to take part in student spring like same people in our group. So my measured and easy life faded into the background. I have to do many study work and make show. It is incredibly difficult, but I know that the results will be excellent. But I have little time to watch anime and films and draw a new pictures. It’s really big problem for me. 
What about my future job it’s demand to be empathic, self-confidence and conscientious. The fate of many people will be in my hands. And it’s great responsibility. It takes a lot of forces to not to burn out.
